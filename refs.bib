  abstract = "Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is
	      of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein
	      function. Some proteins can be found with a single location
	      within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple
	      locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an
	      unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to
	      uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location.
	      Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies
	      on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to
	      sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles.
	      However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated
	      with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the
	      framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a
	      Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models
	      to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus
	      proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular
	      locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the
	      expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain
	      Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide
	      uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the
	      analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible,
	      allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new
	      modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our
	      methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art
	      machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more
	      information. We highlight several examples where classification
	      based on the support vector machine is unable to make any
	      conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach
	      provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this
	      is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.",
